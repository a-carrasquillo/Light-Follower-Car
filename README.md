# Light-Follower-Car
Light follower car using Arduino Uno.
This project purpose is to build an autonomous car that follows the light of flashlight and detects when there is an object in its path.
In order for the car to work in different light environments, the photoresistors are calibrated for five seconds each time the program starts. 
Each time the car changes its direction first stops the engine, then verify if there is an object in its path and lastly,
if there is no object, proceeds to its new direction.
